# About Me - Ryan Butler

My name is Ryan Butler and I'm working towards a Masters of Science in Cybersecurity. I graduated with my undergrad in Information Technology and began finding my interest in Cybersecurity during my undergrad. Although I'm still new to this area, I feel we all are always learning and will always be new to this area. 

I'm wanting to get better at coding because I feel this will help in my path to be a Cybersecurity professional. I've learned over the years and talking with many Cybersecurity professionals, it helps having the basics of programming down, to help in the endevour of becoming a CS Pro. 

I'm new to GitHub, but think this will be my new favorite toy to play with, and share ideas openly across the world. I look forward to working with everyone!
